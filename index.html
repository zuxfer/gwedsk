        After getting engaged in San Francisco, Kamakshi and Gaurav headed north out of the city to Napa Valley. They celebrated their engagement by spending a few romantic days touring wineries and vineyards.

    <p>
        Gaurav had to improvise how he was going to propose to Kamakshi. The original plan was to spend the day hiking Mt. Tamalpais, and when arriving at a scenic view, he'd ask Kamakshi to marry him. But the weather wasn’t going to be accommodating…
    </p>
    <p>
        After a leisurely morning in Union Square, Kamakshi and Gaurav found themselves at the Apple store (where else :). At this point Gaurav was contemplating the possible ways he was going to pull off this proposal. They decided their next stop was going to be the SF MOMA.
    </p>
    <p>
        On their way towards the museum, the weather broke and the Sun came out. Kamakshi had the wise idea that they shouldn’t spend the only sunny time of the day inside. Thinking on his feet, Gaurav suggested they head towards Twin Peaks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once up on Twin Peaks, after looking down on the city from the pedestrian lookout, Gaurav suggested that they hike to the top of one of the hills. At the top they could see the Pacific Ocean, the Golden Gate Bridge, and downtown San Francisco. Looking up at Kamakshi with the city behind him, Gaurav ask Kamakshi to marry him. And of course <strong>she said “Yes!”</strong>

            <p>
                Kamakshi was all ready to meet Gaurav in San Francisco to go on a “vacation” they'd planned. She had no idea Gaurav had an engagement ring with him…
            </p>
            <p>
                At the Boston airport, Kamakshi learned her flight was going to be delayed by three hours. Monster storms were pummeling the Bay Area with rain and high winds; leaving only one runway open at SFO. This meant she wouldn’t arrive until 3:00am PST :(
            </p>
            <p>
                Gaurav was alone in a San Francisco hotel room, anxiously awaiting Kamakshi’s arrival.

            <p>
                Gaurav knew it was time. Kamakshi and he had been together for almost five years, and he wanted to spend his life with her.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gaurav wanted to get a ring that would accurately symbolize his feelings for Kamakshi. He worked with his Mom’s cousin—who’s a third generation jeweler—to create a beautiful custom ring he knew Kamakshi would love.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kamakshi had not expected a thing; she assumed Gaurav was procrastinating on this whole proposal thing and figured she'd have to keep waiting… patiently :)

    <p>
        In late January, Kamakshi and Gaurav went on at snowboarding day-trip-only the two of them. Kamakshi realized that she really liked Gaurav. The next day a work, she decided to tell Gaurav via GChat (such a chicken) that she had feelings for him. Gaurav was shocked! Around that same time he had finally stopped trying to pursue Kamakshi; right when he stopped, the tables turned.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next day Kamakshi and Gaurav went on their first date to a Tapas restaurant near their office. Kamakshi was so nervous that she couldn’t eat :)

    <p>
        <p>Gaurav met Kams when he was in <i>that</i> phase of life where he learnt guitar and jammed his songs up his friends throats ;). Kams was one of the few who genuinely listened to (<i>felt for</i>) him. She actually enjoyed it. </p>
		
		<p>Of course, now that he has become very good at it, every one enjoys "Jam with Nemade" sessions.</p>
		
		<p>Probably should also mention their mutual admiration for <i>Andaz Apna Apna</i>.</p>

    <p>
        Kamakshi and Gaurav were working in Deloitte, but in different divisions. Shortly after Gaurav joined Deloitte, the two met through a common friend during lunch hours.(Obligatory mention about the passionate foodie in Kamakshi :D )
    </p>
    <p>
        Both Gaurav and Kams developed this beautiful friendship that was filled with joy and caring and who knew it would evolve into this marvellous journey for their lives.
