    <h1>Things To Do in the Area</h1>

    <p>
        Since you might be traveling a far distance to attend our wedding, you probably want to stay in the area for a few days. Below are some possible things you could do before or after our wedding while you’re in the Easton, MD area.
    </p>

    <h2>Saint Michaels and Easton</h2>
    <p>
        Our wedding is between Saint Michaels and Easton Maryland. While all of our <a href="../hotels/">hotel suggestions</a> are in Easton, Saint Michaels is the neighboring town. Both have very cute, walkable downtowns, and each has a number of great restaurants and shops. You should be sure to take some time and explore these great little Maryland towns!
    </p>

    <h2>Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum</h2>
    <p>
        An 18 acre waterfront museum that celebrates Chesapeake Bay culture, boats, seafood, and history. October 5th and 6th is the <b>30th Annual Mid-Atlantic Small Craft Festival</b> (small craft means small boats, not arts and crafts).
    </p>
    <div class="details-group l-grid">
        <div class="l-grid-u">
            <ul class="details-content">
                <li><a href="http://cbmm.org/">cbmm.org</a></li>
                <li><b>9:00am &ndash; 5:00pm</b>, daily in October</li>
                <li><b>10/5 &ndash; 10/6:</b> Mid-Atlantic Small Craft Festival</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="l-grid-u">
            <address class="details-content">

    <h2>Boat Shows in Annapolis</h2>
    <p>
        Every Fall, Annapolis hosts two separate boat shows: a Powerboat, and a Sailboat show. These boat shows transforms historical city of Annapolis into a boat mecca. If you’re a boat enthusiast, or are curious to check out the festivities, <em>we highly recommend</em> stopping through Annapolis before or after our wedding. Annapolis is also the city where Leslie grew up.
    </p>
